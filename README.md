It also provides you with strong passwords, one-time codes, and passkeys to secure your online accounts.\
Your passwords are automatically synchronized accross your Apple and other compatible devices.

## Installation

**‚û°Ô∏è Recommended:** Download this extension from [AMO (addons.mozilla.org)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keychain/).

Alternatively, download the latest GitHub release and install it on Firefox by navigating to `about:addons`.

Refer to the following table to see if your configuration is supported:

| Platform                                                                                          | Version         | Status                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macos-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=black) | >= Sonoma (14)  | ‚úÖ Fully supported                                                             |
| ![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macos-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=black) | <= Ventura (13) | [‚ùå Unsupported](https://github.com/au2001/icloud-passwords-firefox/issues/33) |

| ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/windows-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=windowsxp)          | <= Vista        | ‚ùå Unsupported                                                                 |
| ![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/linux-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux)                 | Any             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires additional setup (see below)

### Additional setup (Windows)

For Windows, additional steps are required for the extension to work:

1. Install [iCloud for Windows][icloud-for-windows].
2. Enable the `Passwords` option.
3. Click on `Install Extension...` for either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
4. Download the `icloud_passwords_install` file from the [latest GitHub Release][github-latest-release].
5. Run the downloaded executable **as administrator**.
6. Restart Firefox, and you should be good to go!

### Additional setup (Linux)

For Linux, additional steps are required for the extension to work, as there is no native support for this platform. A Windows virtual machine is needed to enable the functionality:

1. Set up a Windows virtual machine on your Linux host using software like KVM or VirtualBox.
2. Install [iCloud for Windows][icloud-for-windows] in the Windows VM.
3. Enable the `Passwords` option in iCloud for Windows.
4. Click on `Install Extension...` for either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
5. Download the `icloud_passwords_guest_helper` file from the [latest GitHub Release][github-latest-release] in the Windows VM.
6. Run the downloaded executable in the Windows VM (optionally add it to Windows startup).
7. Ensure `socat` is installed on the Linux host (e.g., `sudo apt install socat`).
8. Download the `icloud_passwords_install` file from the [latest GitHub Release][github-latest-release] on the Linux host.
9. Run the following command, replacing `<VM-IP>` with the IP address of your Windows VM:
    ```bash
    ./icloud_passwords_install --mode=tunnel --tunnel-address=<VM-IP>:4646
    ```
10. Restart Firefox, and you should be good to go!

**Note:** The Windows virtual machine must be running whenever you use the extension.

#### Why is this required?

macOS Sonoma (14) and later come with `PasswordManagerBrowserExtensionHelper.app` preinstalled.\
It's a utility which allows Apple's iCloud Passwords Chrome and Edge extensions to work.\
This extension uses the same utility, so it works natively without any further steps.

Unfortunately, this utility is not available on previous versions of macOS, on Windows, nor on Linux.\
For such operating systems, this utility needs to be replaced. iCloud for Windows serves this purpose.\
By default, iCloud for Windows does not grant access to Firefox to access passwords.\
The provided executable thus enables the communication between Firefox and iCloud for Windows.

Linux users can still use this extension by setting up iCloud for Windows in a Windows virtual machine.
By creating a local TCP tunnel, the Linux browser extension can seamlessly connect to iCloud for Windows
running inside the virtual machine.

The source code for the Golang executables is available [in the `scripts/install` directory](https://github.com/au2001/icloud-passwords-firefox/tree/main/scripts/install/).

## News

### 2025-03-10

It is meant to offer an open source alternative to the official version with greatly improved performance.

### 2024-12-04
